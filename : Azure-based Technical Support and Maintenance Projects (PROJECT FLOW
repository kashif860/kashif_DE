In my current project, I am working with a comprehensive technical support and maintenance for Azure-based data engineering solutions,  ensuring the continuous operation and optimization of data pipelines
This project involved resolving data pipeline issues, ensuring SLAs were met, and
Automating key monitoring processes to maintain system health and minimize downtime.
Monitored and maintained Azure Data Factory pipelines for data ingestion and transformation, proactively resolving failures
To ensure data accuracy and minimize processing delays. 
Troubleshoot and resolved escalated issues in real-time related to pipeline failures, data mismatches, and other Azure infrastructure-related problems
This data is available in both structured and unstructured formats.
The structured data is retrieved from Oracle and SQL Server databases.
Both servers are hosted locally rather than on the cloud.
